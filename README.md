[Figma Redesign document](https://www.figma.com/file/ELOJaxxPqc3QnOjwqgVNeLZZ/Recipe-App-Redesign?node-id=4%3A180) - working on Responsive design and Shopping List

### Status

Functionality: 75%  
Design: 50%  
Coming along very well. 

## Overview and Thoughts

### What's Working

Learned a great overview of Angular using [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy Tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/). Highly recommended! 

Working with firebase as a backend and learning AngularFire for data pipeline and authentication.

Have implemented most of the basic recipe app functionality, and gone through a number of [tutorials](https://www.udemy.com/testing-angular-apps/learn/v4/content) regarding TDD. Currently in the process of getting unit and implementation tests set up. 

### What isn't working

All Errors fixed. Everything working as expected (for this point in development)

## Where are we?

### Done:

* Storage, editing and deleteing
* Ingredient to Shopping list
* routing
* Animations
* Persistant login 
* Auto Fetch on Login
* Login Warnings
* User Specific Data
* Mobile Menu
* TestMode
* Multiple "Ingredients" & "Directions" panes
* Mobile menu & recipe overlay - close on select & esc

### Working on Now:
* Redesign - Edit Recipe & Shopping List
* Tooltips for Recipe Detail add to shoppinglist
* Fill out Test Mode Recipes with proper Recipes
* Recipe Detail darkened background for click close

### To Come:

* Implement and maintain TDD
* Recipe Directions and Recipe Ingredients - DRY and Refactor code & put HTML into own component
* Accessibility (signin module removal on close, keyboard tab nav, lighthouse)
* Auto Truncating recipe Strings
* Recipes Sort (Name, Keyword, Ingredients, Date[modified, created])
* Upload Recipe Image
* Shopping List, edit in place
* Loading Spinner for all side effects
* Multiple Shopping Lists
* Form Reset on login
* Warnings for login/register
* Shopping List Saving

### Future thoughts:

* User Dashboard - More an excuse to build a cool dashboard in a SPA, looking forward to it.
* Website Parsing - Have some ideas, but more research is needed. 
* Meal Planning through ingredient tags, Calorie/Nutrient Counting 
* and...?
