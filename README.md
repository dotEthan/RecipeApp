Redesigning Layout now, further TDD will be added after redesign so I'm not testing anything (too much) that will be removed later.

Test Mode Implemented. Can't edit yet, will be adding later. 

[Figma Redesign document](https://www.figma.com/file/ELOJaxxPqc3QnOjwqgVNeLZZ/Recipe-App-Redesign?node-id=4%3A180) - Not sure if that can be linked. Not finished Shopping List or Mobile redesign. Working on it tomorrow. 

### Status

Functionality: 40%  
Design: 20%  
So, early days still.

## Overview and Thoughts

### What's Working

Learned a great overview of Angular using [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy Tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/). Highly recommended! 

Working with firebase as a backend and learning AngularFire for data pipeline and authentication.

Have implemented most of the basic recipe app functionality, and gone through a number of [tutorials](https://www.udemy.com/testing-angular-apps/learn/v4/content) regarding TDD. Currently in the process of getting unit and implementation tests set up. 

### What isn't working

All going well except a strange error with ingredients being null on reload. Not breaking so will track it down after redesign.

## Where are we?

### Done:

* Storage, editing and deleteing
* Ingredient to Shopping list
* routing
* Animations
* Persistant login 
* Auto Fetch on Login
* Login Warnings
* User Specific Data
* Mobile Menu
* TestMode - Add Sample Recipes

### Working on Now:
* Implement and maintain TDD
* Redesign - Overlay working, now to start making it pretty and responsive.
* Test Mode - Edit Recipes

### To Come:

* Measurement types for "amount"
* Form Reset on login
* Mobile Layout
* Remove Recipe Detail Animation
* Warnings for trying to edit or create recipes anonymously
* Shopping List Saving
* Upload Recipe Image
* Improve UI/UX - Most of the current state was done to help learn each aspect of Angular, updates will be made based on ease of use for the end user. 
* User Dashboard - More an excuse to build a cool dashboard in a SPA, looking forward to it.
* Website Parsing - Have some ideas, but more research is needed. 
* Meal Planning through ingredient tags, Calorie/Nutrient Counting 
* and...?
