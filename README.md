Once I implement testing for the current build I'm going to take a break and thoroughly redesign the layout with responsive design and accessibility as the focus. 

Currently you must register, I will be implmenting a "Test Mode" shortly.

### Status

Functionality: 40%  
Design: 20%  
So, early days still.

## Overview and Thoughts

### What's Working

Learned a great overview of Angular using [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy Tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/). Highly recommended! 

Working with firebase as a backend and learning AngularFire for data pipeline and authentication.

Have implemented most of the basic recipe app functionality, and gone through a number of [tutorials](https://www.udemy.com/testing-angular-apps/learn/v4/content) regarding TDD. Currently in the process of getting unit and implementation tests set up. 

### What isn't working

Solved the strange store select error by properly implementing the store in testing. Now to build out the tests. 

## Where are we?

### Done:

* Storage, editing and deleteing
* Ingredient to Shopping list
* routing
* Animations
* Persistant login 
* Auto Fetch on Login
* Login Warnings
* User Specific Data
* Mobile Menu


### Working on Now:
* Implement and maintain TDD
* Rebranding - Name & Logo/Icons
* TestMode - Add Sample Recipes

### To Come:

* TestMode
* Form Reset on login
* Mobile Layout
* Remove Recipe Detail Animation
* Warnings for trying to edit or create recipes anonymously
* Shopping List Saving
* Upload Recipe Image
* Improve UI/UX - Most of the current state was done to help learn each aspect of Angular, updates will be made based on ease of use for the end user. 
* User Dashboard - More an excuse to build a cool dashboard in a SPA, looking forward to it.
* Website Parsing - Have some ideas, but more research is needed. 
* Meal Planning through ingredient tags, Calorie/Nutrient Counting 
* and...?
