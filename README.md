# Recipe App
Landing Page Coming Soon

The early stage starting framework for what I hope to turn into a recipe storage and shopping list app. A proof of concept for my over all idea of a larger, modularized personal assistant app. 

### Status

Functionality: 40%
Design: 20%
So, early days still.

## Overview and Thoughts

### What's Working

Learned a great overview of Angular using [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy Tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/). Highly recommended! 

Working with firebase as a backend and learning AngularFire for data pipeline and authentication

### What isn't working

No problems yet.

## Where are we?

### Done:

* Storage, editing and deleteing
* Ingredient to Shopping list
* routing
* Animations
* Persistant login 
* Auto Fetch on Login
* Login Warnings
* User Specific Data

### To Come:

* Remove Recipe Detail Animation
* Warnings for trying to edit or create recipes anonymously
* Shopping List Saving
* Upload Recipe Image
* Implement and maintain TDD
* Mobile Menu & alterations
* Improve UI/UX - Most of the current state was done to help learn each aspect of Angular, updates will be made based on ease of use for the end user. 
* User Dashboard - More an excuse to build a cool dashboard in a SPA, looking forward to it.
* Website Parsing - Have some ideas, but more research is needed. 
* Meal Planning, Calorie/Nutrient Counting and who knows what else...
